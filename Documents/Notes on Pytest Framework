# Why Pytest

* the most famous unit test framework
* to reduce the cost of change
* faster debugging
* fast development
* better test designing
* to reduce bug in new feature

## change the pycharm setting>tools>python integrated tools>testing: pytest (once pytest installed in pycharm)

### what commands you can perform using pytest
* pytest -h (help in CLI gives all the options)
* pytest will run all files of the form test_*.py or *_test.py in the current directory and its subdirectories.(pytest unit test format)
* else explicitly specify the file name like : pytest xyz.py (only then it will be treated as pytest unit test and it will execute)

#### Run pytest using: pytest <test name>, pytest -v, pytest <directory name>

#### if you want to run only one portion of code to check the code is working or not instead of entire code >> pytest test_math-function.py::test_add

* pytest -k "matching key work" (to run matching test cases/functions in the main programe) you can say filter (and or etc)
* pytest -m <mark> only the marked test cases will run
* pytest -v -x (to exit when encounter the failure, not continue the further test)
* pytest -x --tb=no (exit when failure encounter with no stacktrace)
* pytest -v --maxfail=2 (execute till maxfail 2 then exit)
* -s (to print the print statements)
* -q (quite mode)


There are much more and one should keep exploring them. I have provided the link on the PPT.
